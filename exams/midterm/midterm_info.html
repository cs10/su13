<h4>Material Coverage</h4>
The midterm will test material covered since the beginning of the semester until week 4 (inclusive) -- everything we have done in class (readings, lectures, labs,
homeworks) up through, and including, the Game Theory lecture, except what was covered in discussion.

<h4>Administration</h4>
The midterm will be administered in <em>two parts</em>, a <em>with-BYOB</em> part worth 10 points and a <em>traditional, paper</em> part worth 50 points.
The first <em>with-BYOB</em> part will be administered at
<a href="http://berkeley.edu/map/maps/AB45.html"
style="text-decoration: none;"><strong>200 Sutardja Dai</strong></a>
<strong>during the lab section that you regularly attend</strong>.  Lab starts at 10m after the scheduled start of your lab, and you will begin your lab by filling out a survey. At 30m after the scheduled start of your lab you will be handed a single question and you will have 90m to work on it (until lab ends). For example, if you
attend the 11am to 1pm section, the survey will be completed between 11:10am and 11:30am, and the <em>with-BYOB</em> first part of your midterm will be administered between 11:30am and 1pm.
  The first part of the midterm will be done on the computer, and you will each sit one computer
per student.
You will submit your final answers on <a href="http://bspace.berkeley.edu"
style="text-decoration: none;">bSpace</a>.

<br/><br/>

The second part (the "paper midterm") will be administered at <a href="http://berkeley.edu/map/maps/BC45.html"
style="text-decoration: none;"><strong>TBD</strong></a> from <strong>TBD</strong>.
It will be done on paper, and we will provide a list of the blocks available in Scratch and BYOB
that you can use.  The style of this part of the midterm will be similar to that of the Quest:
we will ask you questions on the readings, on various concepts, and on programming in BYOB.
You are allowed <strong>two study sheets</strong> of size 8.5" x 11", handwritten on both
sides.

<br/><br/>

Please let the staff know if you have a legitimate conflict with the times of the midterm
administrations so that we can make alternate arrangements.  Please let us know <em>by July 18th</em>; we cannot help you if you inform us the day before the midterm.

<h4>Review Session</h4>
There will be a review session for the midterm, from <strong>12pm to 3pm</strong> on
<strong>Sunday July 21st</strong>, at the <a href="http://berkeley.edu/map/maps/AB45.html"
style="text-decoration: none;"><strong>TBD</strong></a>.   The presentation
from the review session will be available here as the date approaches. <!--<a href="http://bit.ly/1326vqu"

<h4>Preparation</h4>
First off, don't panic!  Drink some chamomile tea, take a deep breath, and maybe even
<a href="http://xkcd.com/135/" style="text-decoration: none;">read this
comic strip</a>.  Work through the labs and homeworks once again, and ask questions if anything
is unclear.  We have also posted previous Midterms below. You may find them useful to get a sense
of how the midterm will be structured and what may be on it.
