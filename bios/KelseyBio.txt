WHERE DID YOU GROW UP? WHAT WAS YOUR PATH TO CAL?

I grew up near San Diego. I was admitted to Berkeley as a spring
admit, and I went through the Fall Program for Freshmen in fall
2009. After taking CS 10 in fall 2010, I switched to the Computer
Science major. (I was formerly planning on majoring in MCB.)

HOW MUCH PROGRAMMING HAVE YOU DONE (& WHAT LANGUAGES)?

I have programmed in HTML, BYOB, Scheme, PHP, Java, C++, C, and a
little bit of Python. I am familiar with UNIX, OpenGL, and Maya.

WHAT ARE YOUR HOBBIES?

I sing in the Berkeley Women's Chorale. I also enjoy running and
swimming. I bake an exorbitant amount of cookies.

WHAT ARE SOME OF YOUR TALENTS & SKILLS?

I have an extremely good ear for music. This is probably because my
parents made me start playing the piano at age 4. I am also
exceptionally good at Google searching.

HAVE YOU DONE ANYTHING REMARKABLE? HAS ANYTHING MEMORABLE HAPPENED TO YOU?

I am somewhat well-traveled. My mother, being a history buff, planned
summer vacations to Civil War battlefields and stuff like that, so I
have been all over the East Coast. I've also been to England. (My
family stole a piece of Hadrian's Wall, which is now on display in our
living room.)

WHAT COMMITMENTS WILL BE CONSUMING YOUR CYCLES THIS SEMESTER?

In addition to being a reader, I will be working on campus. I am also
holding a management position in my co-op.
