WHERE DID YOU GROW UP? WHAT WAS YOUR PATH TO CAL?

I grew up here in the East Bay, in a small town called Clayton.  It's
basically a cowboy ghost town; the only thing that's left of it is the
saloon (double doors and everything).  I went to Clayton Valley High
School in the neighboring city of Concord, and came to Berkeley when
I graduated in 2008.

I've programmed in Scheme, Java, C, Python, C++, SQL, HTML, Javascript,
MATLAB, LabView, Scratch, and BYOB.

WHAT ARE YOUR HOBBIES?  WHAT ARE SOME OF YOUR TALENTS & SKILLS?

I enjoy traveling, watching movies, playing basketball, cooking, and
playing video games.
