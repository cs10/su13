WHERE DID YOU GROW UP?  WHAT WAS YOUR ACADEMIC PATH?
I grew up in El Cerrito, which is literally a 10-minute BART ride away from
campus (long trek from home, I know). I went to El Cerrito High, and from there
went to Berkeley in Fall of 2010, which is also when I took the OG (or "first
ever,"ù if you're not hip with the lingo) CS10 course! I came in undeclared in
L&S (heading towards an English route oddly enough), but after I took CS10, I
got hooked into programming, and I will be declaring a Computer Science major
this semester!

HOW MUCH PROGRAMMING HAVE YOU DONE?  WHAT LANGUAGES?
My first language was Scratch/BYOB when I took CS10. After that I learned Scheme
and Java, which I learned in CS61a and CS61b respectively. I have also been
teaching myself some web development languages on the side such as PHP, HTML,
CSS, Javascript and a little SQL. Currently, I'm learning C, Python, UNIX and
becoming more familiar with the aforementioned web development languages.


WHAT ARE YOUR HOBBIES? 
I love to swim (did it competitively for 10 years!), discover new bands to
listen to, play guitar, and try random restaurants!

WHAT ARE SOME OF YOUR TALENTS AND SKILLS?
Again, swimming is a big one. I made it to NCS and Far Westerns senior year of
high school, and had previously competed in the Junior Olympics. Guitar has been
something I picked up more recently, but it's my favorite way to relax. I can
also wiggle my ears. 


HAVE YOU EVER DONE ANYTHING REMARKABLE?
After I took EE42, I got inspired to build my own talkbox, a device that allows
you to shape the sounds of your guitar through your mouth, for my guitar (also,
I didn't have the $250 to drop for one). With some basic circuitry knowledge, a
mini-amp, and some plumbing tools, I was able to build my own fully functional
talkbox! Pretty exciting stuff for me, as it was my first engineering-type
project!

Also, I survived (and did pretty well in) CS61b with Professor Paul Hilfinger.


WHAT COMMITMENTS WILL BE CONSUMING YOUR CYCLES THIS TERM?
In addition to being a reader for CS10, some of the classes I'll be taking
include CS61c (Great Ideas in Computer Architecture), CS70 (Discrete Math and
Probability), and the UNIX SysAdmin DeCal. I'll also be doing CS Education
Research with Professor Dan Garcia, building an awesome project with GSI Luke
Segars, working on human-centered design projects in Berkeley Innovation,
leading the Student Commuters at Cal club as Co-President and Web Developer, and
keeping Berkeley up to date with music as the Lead Music Critic for the Daily
Californian! Looks like a fun semester!
