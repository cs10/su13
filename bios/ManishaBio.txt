WHERE DID YOU GROW UP? WHAT WAS YOUR PATH TO CAL?

I grew up in Suva, Fiji and moved to the United States in 2001, when I was 7. I lived in Hayward, CA., which is only 25 minutes away from Berkeley. I've spent two summers at Cal as a high school student and fell in love with the school. I'm currently going into my sophomore year as an intended Applied Math major.

HOW MUCH PROGRAMMING HAVE YOU DONE (& WHAT LANGUAGES)?

I took CS10 in Spring 2013, so I'm familiar with Scratch, Byob and Snap. I'm currently taking CS61A in which I'm learning python. 


WHAT ARE YOUR HOBBIES?

My hobbies include running, watching movies, reading self-help books, and tutoring.

WHAT ARE SOME OF YOUR TALENTS & SKILLS?

My best talent is being able to wiggle my ears. I have also perfected the art of breakfast-making. 

HAVE YOU DONE ANYTHING REMARKABLE? HAS ANYTHING MEMORABLE HAPPENED TO YOU?

When I lived in Fiji, there was a military coupe in 2000. It was advised for all students to stay home. I somehow convinced my parents to let me go to school and ended up being the only girl and the youngest student in a school of 1,000 kids. That day, my classes went as usual but very personalized, and the Fiji Times came to my school to put me on the front page. 

WHAT COMMITMENTS WILL BE CONSUMING YOUR CYCLES THIS SEMESTER?

I'm taking 6 units this summer and also work as an office assistant.
