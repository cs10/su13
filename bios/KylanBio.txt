WHERE DID YOU GROW UP?  WHAT WAS YOUR ACADEMIC PATH?

I grew up in Fremont, CA and have actually lived in the bay area my entire life.
I love it here! Moving onto my academic path, I actually had no idea I was going
to major in Computer Science until I fell in love with it in CS10! Now I'm
pursuing a double major in Computer Science and Business Administration.


HOW MUCH PROGRAMMING HAVE YOU DONE?  WHAT LANGUAGES?

BYOB, Scratch, Scheme, and Java.

WHAT ARE YOUR HOBBIES?

Playing volleyball (both sand and indoor!), watching movies and a bajillion
different TV shows, cooking, singing, meeting new people, laughing, learning new
things, and I also really, REALLY love teaching.


WHAT ARE SOME OF YOUR TALENTS AND SKILLS?

I did gymnastics for several years before being forced to quit from chipping a
bone in my elbow. After growing a foot after quitting, surprisingly, I can still
do some tricks! 

HAVE YOU EVER DONE ANYTHING REMARKABLE?

I would probably say competing in the Junior Olympics for gymnastics and also
starting two non-profit organizations in high school.


WHAT COMMITMENTS WILL BE CONSUMING YOUR CYCLES THIS TERM?

Teaching is a huge passion of mine so I started a Public Speaking and Leadership
DeCal last semester. I love every moment of teaching it and developing the
course to better my students! I'm also the Co-President of the Student Commuters
at Cal, a board member for the Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs' Student Advisory
Committee, a Regional Coordinator for the Coca-Cola Scholars Foundation,
and am President of the Nestle Very Best in Youth Foundation Board. Other than all
that business,
I'm hoping to really enjoy myself here at Berkeley and utilize as many learning
opportunities as possible.
