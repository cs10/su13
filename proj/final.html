<body> <h2 style="text-align: center;">CS10 Final Project Specification</h2>

<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>We want you to show off everything that you
have learned this semester in a final project of your choice and design.
 Just like the midterm project, you can design anything you want, using
all of your programming knowledge to produce something that is
interesting, useful, and challenging for you.  You are welcome to either
develop your midterm project further, or create an entirely new and
interesting project: if you are doing the former, however, we ask that
you add a substantial amount of code, rather than simply adding new
levels or enemies.  Ultimately, you should spend time designing
algorithms and writing code, as opposed to developing sprite
graphics.</p>

<p style="font-style: italic;">Note: this assignment is almost identical
to the midterm assignment on paper.  The only official difference is that
there is a higher expectation for project quality and complexity.</p>

<h4>Project Proposal</h4> <p>This document should be two or three
paragraphs that describes the overarching purpose of your project.  Is
it a game?  A utility?  A sound-based application?  After describing the
main purpose, discuss the "scope" of the project: the types of things
users will and will not be able to do with it.  This can include a basic
plot line for a game or movie, a list of options for a utility, and so
on.</p>

<p>This is generally a non-technical document and should describe big ideas
more than a description of how it will be done.  We will discuss your
project proposal with you if we have questions about feasibility: in particular, we're interested
in gauging the level of
difficulty of the project, the estimated workload, design choices, and
potential pitfalls.</p>

Only submit ONE per group.
Submission Form Coming Soon

<h4>Project Progress Report</h4>
<p>This document should be around a page or two worth of text in length(depending on the complexity of the project) and should describe how your project has progressed since the
beginning. Among other things, we would like for you to talk about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the general breakdown of work among the members of your project group,</li>
  <li>what kind of milestones you have set and which have been met,</li>
  <li>what problems you have encountered and how you overcame them,</li>
  <li>whether (and how) your project has changed from when you first described it in the project proposal,</li>
  <li>what is left to be done.</li>

</ul>

<p>This should be a reasonably technical document.  Feel free to talk about particular blocks if it helps you communicate your solution.  
Briefly discussing your algorithm for particularly complex problems is welcome as well.  You will also be able to submit this on bSpace.</p>

Only submit ONE per group.
Submission Form Coming Soon

<h4>Project Submission</h4> <p>The official deadline for the project is
<strong>Friday, August 9th at 11:59pm</strong>: a minute
before midnight.  You will submit <strong>three items</strong> on bSpace:

<ol> <li><p>All the files associated with your project.  For most
projects, this will simply be the BYOB file containing your project, but
you should also include any auxiliary files needed for your project to
work.</p></li>

<li>A file named <tt>README</tt>: this is a document (we recommend PDF
documents) that is essentially a manual for your code. The
<tt>README</tt> is directed to any user who is looking at your project
for the first time and wants to know what the project is about, how to
interface with the project, and what the various lists, scores, and
figures mean.  It shouldn't be too long: around 2 to 4 pages (ignoring
pictures) will be fine. You can sprinkle your document with pictures, if
you think that these pictures will explain better.</p>

<p>Also, in your <tt>README</tt>, talk about the significant programming
components of your project.  For example, how did you partition your
work between sprites and blocks?  What can each sprite do and respond
to, and what are the major blocks in your project?  What are the major
lists and what are their purposes? In short, talk about how your project
works on an abstract level, in terms of programming components working
with each other: you don't need to go into specifics.</p> </li>

<li><p>A document called <tt>Partners</tt> that contains only the names
of the people in your project group.</p></li></ol>

<p><strong>Only one person needs to submit the entire project</strong>.
Some of your projects may be huge in terms
of file size.  We recommend that, before you turn in your project, you
use the <tt>Compress Sounds</tt> and <tt>Compress Images</tt> options in
the <tt>Edit</tt> menu to reduce the file size.  The sound quality
should be <tt>Normal</tt> or <tt>Low</tt>, and the image quality should
be <tt>60</tt>.</p>

<!-- p>This document should be around a page or two depending on the
complexity of the project.  You should describe the significant
technical challenges of your project and how you generally plan to
overcome them.  In addition, you should also give us a progress report
discussing what your team has been able to accomplish so far and what's
left to be done.</p> <p>This should be a reasonably technical document.
Feel free to talk about particular blocks if it helps you communicate
your solution.  Briefly discussing your algorithm for particularly
complex problems is welcome as well.</p> -->

<h4>Requirements</h4> <ol> <li>There must be a clear way to start your
program.  Using the green flag is the recommended approach.</li> <li>If
you create a game, it has to be a game with a purpose, in the broadest
sense of the term.  It could be a training game, or an educational game,
or one to test an HCI question you want to answer (e.g., whether it is
more efficient to use the QWERTY keyboard versus the DVORAK keyboard),
or for some other purpose.  <i>It can't be for purely entertainment
purposes.</i></li>
<li>"Style" points will be awarded for things like well-commented and
nicely structured code.  Poor structure can include things like
duplicated code, needlessly complicated organization or program flow,
and so on.</li> <li>Create some of your own blocks.</li> <li>Use lists
in your project in some way.</li> <li>You cannot work alone, but can
either work in pairs or groups of three.  Expectations will be higher
for larger groups.</li> </ol>

<h4>Grading</h4> <div style="margin-left: 25px;"> <table rows=2 cols=2>
<tr> <td>Project specification</td> <td>10 pts</td> </tr> <tr> <td
style="width: 245px;">Project progress report</td> <td>&nbsp; 5 pts</td>
</tr> <tr> <td>Meeting your specification</td> <td>20 pts</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>Style</td> <td>10 pts</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Meeting technical
requirements</td> <td>15 pts</td> </tr> <tr> <td><em>Total</em></td>
<td><em>60 pts</em></td> </tr> </table> </div>

<h4>Tips</h4> <ol> <li>Remember that you have slip days!  At the
beginning of the semester, we gave you three slip days for homework and
projects, which means that you can use these slip days to work on your
projects beyond the deadline, without detriment to your project grade.
However, these slip days are <em>cumulative</em>:  this means that for
all the assignments in this semester, you can only use a total of three
slip days.  Since
you are working in groups, the slip days don't
accumulate: every person loses a slip day for each day that your project
comes in after the deadline. 25% of your project grade will be deducted
for each day beyond the deadline once you run out of slip days.</li>
<li>As you work through your projects, we ask
that you comment your code to make it easier for us to grade, and also
to make it easier for any person who wants to know how your code
works.</li> <li><em>Please save copies of your projects frequently.</em>
 In particular, if you think that your project is at a stable state,
save a backup copy elsewhere, before you make any substantial changes to
it.  This will allow you to "roll back" to a stable copy of your project
if you make a substantial buggy change.</li>
<li>If you had performance problems with your midterm project, think about
the components that made it slow down.  Plan that into your work so that
you can get core stuff working before bogging your entire project down.  We've
noticed that huge lists, lots of sprites, and a crowded stage can slow things
down so try to control those elements as much as possible.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Extra Credit</h4>
<p>A small amount of extra credit will be available for the project if you choose a socially relevant topic (education, health, etc).  The amount of extra credit will be based on the intensity of impact (how much it affects the targeted population) and the range of people that it impacts (the size of the population).</p>

<h4>Extra Credit: Video Presentation</h4>
There will also be a point or two of EC available for making a youtube walk-through of your project. Once uploaded, please upload it to Piazza<!--<a href="https://piazza.com/class#fall2012/cs10/284">Piazza</a>-->.<br>
Some information about capturing the video is <a href="videos/index.html"><b>here</b></a>.

<h4>Other projects</h4>
<p>You're welcome to work on almost any project that interests you.  Here are some ideas of projects
that have been successful in the past to fuel your thinking, but feel free to do something totally
different if you'd prefer.</p>

<h4>A Word of Warning (again)</h4>
<p>As you probably now know, getting to design projects of your own can
be exciting, and it is very easy to underestimate how long it will take
to accomplish a particular goal.  Remember: although the GSIs will
be happy to help you bring your idea to life, you won't have lab-like
guidelines for making this happen.  It may take a lot longer to make
your project than you think!</p>

<p>That being said, don't hold back if you think you can make something
truly grand.  We're here to help you if you've got an idea that you
love.</p> </body> </html>
